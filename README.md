JavaScript Wrapper for the zukijourney API.

This repository aims to be a useful collection of JavaScript modules that make using the zukijourney API easier.

To use this wrapper, you only need to download the Modules folder and the package.json file (you can also just clone this repository locally or download the ZIP file).

The file main.js has some example code on how to use the wrapper.

Currently, this repository is only meant to be used for chat completions, namely the OpenAI models. Image generation is supported as well, to some extent.

While the concept of a zukijourney API wrapper might be no different than an OpenAI JavaScript wrapper, there are specific quirks of the zukijourney API that this repository handles which make it more accessible.

Special thanks to [@N. R](https://github.com/bornlikeariver) for making an amazing Wiki page for this wrapper: https://github.com/Sabsterrexx/zukiJS/wiki
